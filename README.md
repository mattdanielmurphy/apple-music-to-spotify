# Apple Music / iTunes to Spotify

I made this because I was disappointed with the app I paid for, and I didn't feel like paying for another. Right now, setting this up requires a lot of convoluted steps--I'd like to fix that and streamline the process rather than list all the steps required because nobody will (or should) do it.

Fun sidenote: The second I finished this project I discovered that switching to Spotify was totally the wrong move, because they impose an insane and arbitrary 10 thousand song limit for one's library. I discovered this when my requests to save albums stopped working. A sad time it was. Back to Apple Music I went.
